==================================================
               MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC REPORT
==================================================

Patient Information:
--------------------
{patient_info}


Tumor Characteristics:
--------------------
- General description of the detected tumor (growth rate, aggressiveness, common locations).
- Estimated tumor size based on bounding box width and height (W={W}, H={H}).
- Approximate affected brain region if possible (do NOT mention X, Y directly).

Clinical Interpretation:
--------------------
- Medical implications of the detected tumor.
- Prognosis hints, risks, and typical clinical evolution.

Suggested Next Steps:
--------------------
- Recommend immediate actions (biopsy, further imaging, specialist referral).
- Mention if urgent referral is needed.
- Provide supportive advice for doctors and patients.

Notes:
--------------------
- Cautionary advice and urgent warning symptoms.
- Importance of early intervention.

==================================================

Important:
- Be formal, accurate, supportive, and easy to understand.
- Avoid using technical coordinate references or jargon unfamiliar to non-medical readers.
